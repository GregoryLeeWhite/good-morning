Good morning is an AngularJS web application that greets the user with a different greeting based on the time of day and displays the current time.
It uses the weather underground web api to search for the local weather based on geolocation.  On page load,
a random background image that google uses for Chromecast is displayed as the background image.

Here is a link to the app running on Github Pages: http://gregoryleewhite.github.io/good-morning/
