Good morning is a web application that greets the user with a different greeting based on the time of day.
It uses the weather ground web api to search for the local weather based on geolocation.  On page load,
a random background image that is google uses for Chromecast is displayed as the background image.

It looks friggen tight full screen, so press dat F11, ya herd?
